# 3648. Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-sensors-to-cover-grid/)

---

You are given `n &times; m` grid and an integer `k`.

A sensor placed on cell `(r, c)` covers all cells whose **Chebyshev distance** from `(r, c)` is **at most** `k`.

The **Chebyshev distance** between two cells `(r_1, c_1)` and `(r_2, c_2)` is `max(|r_1 &minus; r_2|,|c_1 &minus; c_2|)`.

Your task is to return the **minimum** number of sensors required to cover every cell of the grid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, m = 5, k = 1

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Placing sensors at positions `(0, 3)`, `(1, 0)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(4, 1)` ensures every cell in the grid is covered. Thus, the answer is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 2, k = 2

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

With `k = 2`, a single sensor can cover the entire `2 * 2` grid regardless of its position. Thus, the answer is 1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^3`
- `1 <= m <= 10^3`
- `0 <= k <= 10^3`
